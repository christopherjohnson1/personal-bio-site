    <p class="bio">I have enjoyed experimenting with various technologies since I was a child.<br> 
      One of my favorite stories is when I was younger and it was common to have a family PC, I would<br>
      "borrow" the RAM from my father's computer so my gaming experience would be enhanced. I have wanted to<br>
      get into coding/ development for some time now, but on a trip to Denver in 2019 one of my friends was<br>
      able to work remotely and that was so cool to see someone having that freedom. The thing I love about<br> 
      development is the problem solving, it is so rewarding whenever you solve a problem you were working on.</p>
